🧭 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze global economic and demographic trends by leveraging SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for dynamic visualization and storytelling. The goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable insights into macroeconomic indicators, population dynamics, and regional disparities to inform strategic planning, policy formulation, and investment decisions.

📊 Business Objectives
- Trend Identification: Detect long-term patterns in GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, population shifts, and urbanization across countries and regions.
- Comparative Analysis: Benchmark countries based on economic performance and demographic indicators.
- Forecasting: Enable predictive modeling of future trends using historical data.
- Decision Support: Provide executives and analysts with intuitive dashboards to guide policy and investment strategies.

🛠️ Technical Scope
1. Data Sources
- World Bank, IMF, UN datasets
- National statistical agencies
- CSV, Excel, and SQL-based repositories
2. SQL Tasks
- Data Ingestion: Import raw datasets into structured SQL tables.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, normalize formats, and remove duplicates.
- Transformation: Aggregate metrics (e.g., GDP per capita), calculate growth rates, and join demographic and economic datasets.
- Query Optimization: Ensure efficient retrieval for large-scale datasets.
3. Power BI Tasks
- Data Modeling: Create relationships between economic and demographic tables.
- Visualizations:
- Time-series charts for GDP, inflation, and population growth
- Choropleth maps for regional comparisons
- KPI cards for top-performing countries
- Slicers for year, region, and indicator selection
- Interactivity: Drill-through reports, tooltips, and dynamic filters
- Deployment: Publish dashboards to Power BI Service with scheduled refreshes

🔍 Key Metrics and Dimensions
- Economic Metrics: GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate, trade balance
- Demographic Metrics: Population size, age distribution, fertility rate, migration rate
- Dimensions: Country, region, year, income group, development status

📈 Use Cases
- Policy Analysts: Evaluate the impact of demographic shifts on labor markets.
- Investors: Identify emerging markets with favorable economic indicators.
- NGOs: Target regions with high population growth and economic vulnerability.
- Educators: Use visualizations for teaching global development trends.
